## 4. Financial Engineering & Quantitative Finance Track

*Once you are comfortable with statistics/probability, econometrics, micro/macro, and financial markets, start this section. These courses will make your roadmap equivalent to a real Financial Engineering/Quant Finance path.*

**A. Stochastic Processes & Advanced Math for Finance**
- **[MIT OCW – Introduction to Financial Mathematics (18.S096)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/)**
    - Brownian motion, Ito’s lemma, SDEs, essential for quant finance.

**B. Financial Derivatives and Options Pricing**
- **[Coursera – Financial Engineering and Risk Management (Columbia)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-engineering-1)**
    - Derivatives, options, swaps, pricing models, risk management.

**C. Risk Management and Quantitative Investing**
- **[Coursera – Computational Investing, Part I (Georgia Tech)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-investing)**
    - Quant portfolio management, CAPM, risk/return, factor models, Python projects.

**D. Financial Modeling/Programming (Python/Excel/R)**
- Integrated in Computational Investing and MIT 14.32.
- **[MIT OCW – The Analytics Edge (15.071) (optional, for R)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-071-the-analytics-edge-spring-2017/)**

---

## 5. Go Even Deeper (Extra)

- **[Coursera – Financial Markets (Yale, Free to Audit)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global)**
    - Supplement to the Yale course, with quizzes and assignments.
- **Capstone/Portfolio:** Build your own coding projects for option pricing, portfolio optimization, etc., to showcase your skills.

---

## How to Use This Roadmap

- **Move through each stage in order**—don’t start the Financial Engineering section until you are solid with stats/probability, econometrics, micro/macro, and markets.
- **Listen to podcasts and follow IMF/BIS for ongoing real-world context** (do this in parallel with your core studies).
- **Mix and match courses as you like**, but always ensure you have the prerequisites before starting advanced/FE courses.
- **Document your work** (notes, project code, written explanations) for maximum retention and to build a portfolio.
